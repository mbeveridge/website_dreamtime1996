      <p>Being an Arsenal supporter can be a pretty frustrating experience. However, since
       the genius of Dennis Bergkamp was plucked from the backwaters of Italy's Serie A,
       we have been linked with almost every top quality player (and plenty of the others
       too) that you can think of.</p>
      <p>Ian Grant at
       <a href="http://www.netlink.co.uk/users/arseweb/" target="_top">ArseWeb</a>
       compiles a good weekly
       <a href="http://www.netlink.co.uk/users/arseweb/current/news/reviews/" target="_top">summary</a>
       of the rumours from the press and radio, together with his own comments.</p>

      <p>Ajax Amsterdam have been the focus of a lot of attention in the football media over
       the past couple of years, with a young team of talented players and a flowing &
       flexible passing game.</p>
      <p>The loss of a large part of the 95/96 team (through transfers and injuries) has
       caused major problems for their small squad, and the pitch at the new Amsterdam
       Arena has yet to bed down properly - bad news for a team that tries to play the ball
       on the ground.</p>
      <p>However, the well-documented Ajax youth programme and scouting network, and a
       willingness to play youngsters if they are good enough, means that they are able to
       fill the gaps when "irreplaceable" stars are sold (usually to Serie A). Watch out
       for Dave Van den Bergh according to World Soccer's 1996 review of "The new generation"
       of world players.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.gis.net/~youme/aaa/" target="_top">Amazing (?) Ajax Archive</a>
       is based around news about Ajax and their players/ targets from the European papers,
       but includes news about <i>Oranje</i> (Dutch national side), ex-Ajacids (eg.
       Bergkamp, Seedorf, Davids) and others.</p>
