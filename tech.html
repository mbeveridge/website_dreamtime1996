      <p>These are popping up all over the place - not really surprising when you consider
       the medium. The quality varies widely, but content's a personal thing; so if I think
       a big corporate site spouts rubbish, you may have a totally different opinion. Life
       would be pretty boring otherwise.</p>

       is a "weekly summary of events in the consumer online services industry". It focuses
       mainly on the service providers (AOL, Compuserve, etc), which I don't find all that
       interesting. However, near the bottom is "NewsWorthy Notes" ...and often a couple of useful
       links.</p>

       material.</p>
