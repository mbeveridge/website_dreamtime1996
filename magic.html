      <p>To quote from the blurb at the bottom of General Magic press releases :</p>
      <p><font size=3><em>"General Magic, Inc. (Nasdaq: GMGC) was founded in 1990 and
       provides engaging, active Internet software for business professionals, developers,
       device manufacturers, service providers and enterprises. General Magic is
       headquartered in Sunnyvale, California, with offices in Paris and Tokyo. For more

      <p>If you didn't find what you were after at General Magic's own site, I suggest you try
       <a href="http://users.aol.com/darkdan/mc2000.html" target="_top">DarkDan's site</a>
       for a wealth of product information - both current and "in the pipeline".</p>
      <p>If you're a <a href="http://www.genmagic.com/MagicCap/" target="_top">Magic Cap</a>
       user, then there's a <a href="news:comp.os.magic.cap" target="_top">newsgroup</a>
       you may find useful ...user comments and questions, and some feedback from GMGC
       employees and developers. It's getting less interesting; a lot of the traffic is
       probably going to the mailing list : (sorry, I don't have details).</p>

       software enables the creation of new networks by providing a new communications
       architecture using intelligent mobile software programs ("agents") that route
       themselves through networks and perform various tasks on behalf of a user, from
       carrying messages to executing transactions."

     <p><u>Steve G Steinberg</u> in Wired [Feb. 1996] :</p>
     <font size=3>
      <p><em>"Because Telescript was designed with agents in mind, it offers significant
       technical advantages over Java. Most importantly, Telescript programs can retain
       items in memory as they travel from computer to computer, while Java programs forget
       everything when they move to a new computer."</em></p>
      <p><em>"Only when we put machines into the loop and use computer power to filter and
       search for information will the Web truly begin to transform our lives."</em></p>
     </font>

     <p><u>Jim White, Vice President of Telescript Technology</u> at General Magic, in a
      mobilis interview (Parts
      <a href="http://www.volksware.com/mobilis/march.96/" target="_top">I</a> and
      <a href="http://www.volksware.com/mobilis/april.96/" target="_top">II</a>) :</p>
     <font size=3>
      <p><em>"Telescript was invented so that personal devices of all kinds ...could use
       the resources of a network in a manner consistent with the resources of the devices
       themselves."</em></p>
      <p><em>"...Java does things Telescript doesn't, and does them well. ...Applets help
       to create the user interface; agents animate the server."</em></p>
      <p><em>"Any network application with a non-trivial user interface is a candidate for
       at least a partial implementation in Java. Any application that makes non-trivial
       use of the network is a candidate for at least partial implementation in Telescript.
       There's great overlap between these two sets of applications."</em></p>
      <p><em>"This January [1996] General Magic demonstrated Telescript-Java
       interoperability at Demo 96."</em></p>

     <p> Extracts from
      "<a href="http://www.upside.com/texis/search/~GABJe5NjRj4GGG/article.html" target="_top">Dangerous Liaisons</a>"
      : <u>Richard Brandt</u> in Upside magazine, Dec 1995 :</p>
     <font size=3>
      <em><p>Michael Spindler doesn't have it. Lou Gerstner doesn't have it. John Sculley
       never did. Not even Bill Gates has it, really. It's that old Steve Jobs charisma :
       the style, the conviction, the sheer salesmanship that became the Apple Computer Inc.
       founder's trademark, allowing him to create not just a new computer and a new
       company, but a whole new industry.</p>
      <p>Marc Porat has it. The CEO of General Magic Inc. in Mountain View, Calif., a former
       member of Apple Computer's elite Advanced Technology Group, is an evangelist built in
       the image of Steve Jobs : bright, articulate, technologically adept and bravely
       ambitious. Porat is the kind of guy who can mesmerise with his speech, move the press
       into lavish praise and talk corporate executives from New Jersey to Tokyo into paying
       tithes and signing onto his particular vision of the information highway. "As a
       pitchman," says Jean-Louis Gassee, the former Apple executive who first hired Porat
       at Apple, "he puts Steve Jobs to shame."</p>
      <p>Porat can paint a vision that looks like paradise. It's a world where personal
       communicators sit in your pocket, automatically organizing your schedule, reminding
       you of appointments, alerting you to upcoming events and even sending software
       "agents" or virtual robots onto worldwide networks to do your bidding.</p>
      <p>In the last few years, Porat has built General Magic into one of the darlings of
       the comuter industry. He raised an astounding $77 million from some huge names in
       technology and communications, including Apple, AT&T Corp., Sony Corp., Motorola
       Inc., Matsushita Electrical Industrial and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp.
       (NTT). When it went public early this year, General Magic's stock nearly doubled on
       its first day of trading, making it one of the hottest high-tech IPO's around (until
       the arrival of Netscape Communications Corp., also of Mountain View).</p>
      <p>Since then, however, the General Magic magic has waned. Marc Porat is repeating a
       lesson that his role model learned in his Next venture : Charisma is not always
       enough. With its first products sagging and many of its burned-out executives now
       bailing out, General Magic is rapidly becoming known in the high-tech community as one
       of the most overhyped companies in the world (until the arrival of Netscape).</p></em>
